Description

This project is a dynamic Reddit client that allows users to create multiple subreddit lanes and view posts from each subreddit. Users can add or remove lanes, and each lane displays post titles, authors, and vote counts.

The project fetches data from Reddit’s JSON feed (https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}.json). Currently, CORS restrictions in the browser prevent full API integration, so the project is still under development.

The app is built with Vite, React, and TailwindCSS, and demonstrates state management, asynchronous data fetching, and responsive UI design. Local storage is used to save custom lanes.
